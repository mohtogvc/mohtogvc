        <p>
            On this page, you'll learn how to <a href="#connect">connect to </a>, how to <a href="#effects">apply effects</a>
            to your voice, how to <a href="#sounds">play back pre-recorded sounds</a>, and how to

        </p>

        <h2 id="connect">Connecting to </h2>
        <p>
            To use  Voice Changer Pro, you need the Windows desktop version of  running.
            When you launch  Voice Changer Pro, you'll see an icon indicating whether it has
            successfully detected and attached to . If the desktop version of  is not running
            you'll see the following:
        </p>

        <img src="images/-not-running.png" alt="Screenshot:  not running" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            If  is running, then  Voice Changer Pro will attempt to attach to it.
            If permission has not yet been granted, you will see the following status:
        </p>

        <img src="images/awaiting-authorization.png" alt="Screenshot: Awaiting authorization" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            If you see the awaiting authorization status, you will need to go into  and allow access, so that  Voice Changer Pro can
            communicate with . You'll need to click the "Allow Access" button.
        </p>

        <img src="images/allow-access.png" alt="Screenshot: Allow access" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            Once you have done this  Voice Changer will be able to attach, and you should see a notification message similar to the following:
        </p>

        <img src="images/-api.png" alt="Screenshot:  API notification" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            And in  Voice Changer, you'll see the following notification that we are attached to . Congratulations - now we are ready
            to start using  Voice Changer Pro.
        </p>

        <img src="images/attached.png" alt="Screenshot:  attached" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <h2 id="effects">Using Effects</h2>

        <p>
            Using an effect in  Voice Changer Pro couldn't be easier. Simply select the effect you would like to apply to your
            voice from the list on the left in the effects screen (click on "effects" to get to this screen):
        </p>

        <img src="images/effects2.png" alt="Screenshot: Effects screen" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            There are several fun effects to choose from, and more to come in the future. By default "None" is selected, which means your
            voice will be unchanged by  Voice Changer Pro. All the other effects will modify your voice, so that the person you are
            speaking to hears the effect. Their voice will not be changed by the effect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each effect also comes with one or more parameter sliders, allowing you to fine tune the way they sound to be just what you want. So for example
            you might want just want a small amount of pitch shift applied to your voice, or you might want to go crazy! You can even adjust these
            parameters in real-time during a conversation. Please note that the sliders can only be used by licensed users.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember!<em>You won't be hearing the change to your voice during the conversation.</em> This is because  does not play the
            sound of your own voice back to you during a call (if it did, you could end up with echo problems on your call).
        </p>

        <p>
            So to help you understand what each effect sounds like, there is a handy <b>Preview</b> button at the bottom of the effects panel.
            You can use this at any time so long as a call isn't in progress. It will simply play back a short pre-recorded message through your
            soundcard, using the selected effect. This will give you an idea of what the effect does.
        </p>

        <p>
            There's another great way to test out the effects, and that's to make a call to 's own "Echo Test Service". This allows you to place a 
            call which will record your voice and play it back to you. This is a great way to hear what the various effects in  Voice Changer Pro
            will sound like to the other person on your call.
        </p>

        <p>Listen to the effects on offer in this tutorial video:</p>

        <h2 id="sounds">Play Back Pre-Recorded Sounds</h2>

        <p>
            On the sounds screen, you can play back a sound for the other person to hear. To access the sounds screen, simply click on the word Sounds.
        </p>

        <img src="images/sounds2.png" alt="Screenshot: Sounds screen" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
             Voice Changer Pro comes with a small selection of fun built in sounds for you to make use of in your calls. To trigger any sound, simply press
            the green play button beside the name of the sound. A progress bar will show you how far through playback you are. To stop a sound midway through,
            simply press play again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember! <em>You will not hear the sounds while you are in a call</em> - only the person you are speaking to will hear them. However, while you
            are not in a call, you can click the play button to hear the sounds. Also, a maximum of three sounds can be played at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you've <a href="purchase.html">purchased a license</a> for  Voice Changer Pro, then you will not only be able to replay the built-in
            sounds, but <b>load your own sounds in</b>. Simply click "Add New Sound", and browse to a media file on your computer. We support most common audio file
            formats, and will automatically convert it into an appropriate format for playing in . A maximum file length of 10 minutes is supported. Once you're
            done with that sound, you can delete it safely in  Voice Changer Pro, without the original file you imported being touched.
        </p>

        <h2 id="record">Record your Calls</h2>

        <p>
            If you've <a href="purchase.html">purchased a license</a> for  Voice Changer Pro
            then you can record your conversations in a variety of different formats. To access the recording settings, go to the
            Recording screen by clicking on the word "Record".
        </p>

        <img src="images/recording.png" alt="Screenshot: Recording screen" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            To set up  Voice Changer Pro to record conversations, you need to simply check the Record checkbox. Licensed users will be able to record full calls,
            while <b>unlicensed users can only record the first 30 seconds.</b> Also, licensed users can select from a variety of compressed audio file types
            (availability depends on which version of Windows you are running), and you can even save each speaker's audio separately. Here's a rundown of the available options.

            When a call finishes, it is added to the list of recordings and a green dot beside the recording indicates that this is a new call.
            From here you can play the recording (will launch Windows Media Player), delete it, or open the folder in which the calls are stored.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember! <em>Recorded can take up a lot of disk space</em>. Delete calls you no longer have need for, or archive them into another folder.

        </p>

        <p>
            If you are using a version of Windows that does not include an MP3 encoder and would still like to
            convert your recordings to MP3, lots of popular audio convertor programs will do this for you. One good one is
            <a href="http://rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php">lame.exe</a>. Just save your calls as WAV, and then convert them
            afterwards.

        <h2 id="speech">Speak using a Computer Generated Voice</h2>

        <p>
            On the Speech page, you can use a built-in computer generated voice to say whatever you type.
        </p>

        <img src="images/speech.png" alt="Screenshot: Speech screen" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            The voices available to you will depend on which version of Windows you have installed. Microsoft have many different voices,
            including Microsoft Desktop Sam, Anna, Zira, Heena, David, and Hazel. Each voice has its own character and accent.
            Usually you will have at least one of these available, and Windows 8 and above users should have two or three options available.
        </p>

        <p>
            To try out a voice, simply type a phrase into the textbox and press play. If you're not in a call, you'll hear the phrase spoken with
            your selected voice. You can also save time, by adding the phrases you've created to a list of saved phrases, ready for when you are
            in a call. Remember! <em>You will not hear the voice while you are in a call</em> - only the person you are speaking to will hear it.
            Only one phrase can be spoken at a time, and if you try to play another while one is playing, it will be queued up.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll get to try out this feature for 14 days after installing, but if you want to continue using it after that, you will need to
            <a href="purchase.html">purchase a license</a>.
        </p>


        <h2 id="license">Installing Your License</h2>

        <p>
            If you've purchased  Voice Changer Pro, then in your confirmation email, you should have received a link to a license file with a ".lic" extension.
            Download this, and save it somewhere on your computer. In the top right hand corner, you will see a link saying "Unlicensed" as shown in the following image:
        </p>

        <img src="images/unlicensed.png" alt="Screenshot: Unlicensed" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>

        </p>

        <img src="images/license-entry.png" alt="Screenshot: License entry" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            In the license entry, screen, click the "browse to license", and browse to the .lic file you downloaded from the link in the confirmation email.
            Once you have done this, you will be thanked with the following message.
        </p>

        <img src="images/thank-you.png" alt="Screenshot: Thank You" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive">

        <p>
            Once you close this message, you will see your name in the top right hand corner, and you will be able to access all the
            functionality of  Voice Changer Pro.

<div class="row" id="faq">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3 class="highlight">Will it work on my machine?</h3>
    <p>
        The best way to answer that question is to try it! It costs nothing to install, and you'll be able to record 30
        seconds of your call to hear what sounds and effects the other person was hearing after the call has ended. The basic
        requirements are Windows (Vista, 7, 8, or 10). For best results, make sure you
        have the latest <a href="https://www..com/en/download-/-for-computer/" target="_blank">desktop version of </a>
        installed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">What can the trial edition do?</h3>
    <p>
        The trial edition lets you access seven voice effects, replay 6 built-in pre-recorded sounds, and
        record the first 30 seconds of your calls in WAV format only. You can also try out the speech synthesis feature
        for 14 days.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">What do I get by purchasing a license?</h3>
    <p>
        By purchasing a license you'll unlock the full capabilities of  Voice Changer Pro. This means you'll be able
        to <b>record your entire calls</b>, as well as be able to select from a number of <b>additional recording formats</b> such as WMA,
        AAC or MP3 (exact formats available depend on your version of Windows). You'll also be able to <strong>
            record both the
            inbound and outbound portions
        </strong> of a call separately. You'll be able to <b>import your own sounds</b> to replay,
        rather than being restricted to the built-in ones. You'll also gain access to the ability to <strong>
            adjust the effects parameters
            in real-time
        </strong> to fine tune the effects. You'll also be able to say anything in a <b>computer generated voice</b> using the speech synthesis feature.
        Finally, as a paying user you'll benefit from free lifetime updates, so you'll get immediate access to all future improvements and features.
    </p>

    <h3 class="highlight">Why can't I hear my voice / sounds during calls?</h3>
    <p>
        To prevent a feedback loop where the the person you are talking to doesn't hear multiple echoes of the same sound, we currently do
        not play the sound of your modified voice or the sounds you are replaying back to you during a call. We have some ideas about how we could
        make this possible for people using headsets, so watch out this in for a future update.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">How can I test that the effects and sounds are working?</h3>
    <p>
        The best way of testing  Voice Changer is to make a call to the <b>Echo / Sound Test Service</b>. This
        will record your voice and play it back to you. That way you get to hear what the effects and sounds that you have played sound like
        to the other user.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">Are conference calls supported?</h3>
    <p>
        The current version of  Voice Changer Pro just works with a two person conversation. But conference calls are definitely a feature
        we'd like to add in the future, if there is enough demand.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">How many computers can I install it on?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are the only person using your license of  Voice Changer Pro, then you can install it on up to three computers. If you are sharing
        your license with family members, then you may only install it on one computer. Businesses must buy a license for each user of the software.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight" id="alter-call">Can I record to MP3?</h3>
    <p>
        If you purchase a license,  Voice Changer Pro will unlock the option to record your calls in WMA, AAC or MP3, if your version of Windows has those
        encoders available. By default, all supported versions of Windows will have WMA available. Windows 7 and above will support AAC (MP4 audio), and
        you'll need Windows 8 or newer for the MP3 encoder to appear (unless you have installed a separate MP3 encoder on your machine). If you happen to be
        running  Voice Changer on a Server edition of Windows, you may need to install the "Desktop Experience" Windows component for these options to
        appear.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight" >Why am I getting an error saying that  cannot intercept the audio?</h3>
    <p>
        We are aware that in recent versions of , some users have been unable to use  Voice Changer Pro when making outgoing calls. This is unfortunately
        due to an issue with the  Desktop API that  Voice Changer Pro relies on in order to intercept the audio. If you are encountering this problem,
        one workaround you may be able to use is to try with a different  account. Another option is to go back to an earlier version of .
        For example, <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/windows/-7-16-0-102"> v7.16.0.102</a> is known to work. Another site offering downloads of previous versions of  is <a href="https://filehippo.com/download_/history/">File Hippo</a>.

    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">What can I do if I have a problem?</h3>
    <p>
        The best way to see if  Voice Changer is right for you is to install the trial version first, and see if it works with
        your computer. However, if you have bought a license and are having any troubles getting it working on your computer, please contact us at
